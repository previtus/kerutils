# kerutils
* Python Keras Utilities required for my
  [deep learning notebooks](http://www.samyzaf.com/ML)
* This package is fit for Keras 1
* If you use Keras 2, please install kerutils 2.xx (from pypi): pip install kerutils
* Some of the utilities (especially those in imgutils.py) are specifically designated for the examples
  in my
  [deep learning notebooks](http://www.samyzaf.com/ML),
  but can easily be tailored for general usage if desired.
